# Development loop journal

This is the tracked hand-off record for bounded development loops. Read the
newest entry before starting a new loop. Before closing or handing off a
session, append an entry with discoveries, accomplishments, immutable evidence,
unresolved work, and the exact next starting point. Keep private paths,
biological inputs, credentials, licensed files, and generated results outside
Git.

## 2026-08-11 — Exact predicted model to first-copy MR boundary

### Discoveries

- Marmic compute nodes cannot reach the public AlphaFold API reliably. The
  fixed P1 profile therefore retrieves one authorised exact model on the login
  node, records seven SHA-256 hand-off checksums, and verifies them before
  offline compute-node use.
- One exact AFDB v6 coordinate for the pilot catalogue mapped at identity and
  coverage 1.0. Phenix 2.1-6048 confidence processing retained 429 of 442
  residues and produced identical processed-model bytes on macOS and Linux;
  platform-specific Phenix-manifest provenance intentionally changes the model
  identity.
- The CD6 target has one retained physically plausible copy hypothesis; higher
  tested copy counts are physically impossible for that candidate and must not
  enter the first-copy funnel even if a generic retention cap includes them.
- A real local Phenix 2.1-6048 probe against the public 8OOX positive control
  established the command and output conventions. With total composition of
  two copies and a one-copy search, the top refined solution had LLG 1622.9 and
  TFZ 49.7. Phaser can report an early packing advisory while the final packing
  table accepts the solution, so the parser must use final evidence and retain
  advisories rather than treating the first warning as a tool failure.
- `phaser.output_dir` did not relocate output in the observed command-line mode.
  The production adapter must instead execute in a hypothesis-owned working
  directory through the isolated Phenix runtime.

### Accomplishments and immutable evidence

- Commit `c901dafe585d1b68b117d7d216e5053ef4985230` passed the fixed Marmic P1
  discovery and predicted-model preparation slice, including a fully cached
  resume. The run ID and machine-specific paths remain in ignored local
  evidence, not this journal.
- Commit `95e6e4f30d536f39a69269aaff317f9d5492533d` recorded the passing M2 slice;
  GitHub Actions run `31472841538` completed successfully.
- The repository was clean before the current funnel implementation began.

### Unresolved work

- Implement the exact-predicted-model funnel with explicit feature fields,
  checksum verification, physically impossible-row exclusion, deterministic
  ordering, and profile/config hard caps.
- Implement and fixture-test the first-copy Phaser command, parser, strict
  provisional `LLG > 100` and `TFZ > 10` gate, final packing interpretation,
  and hit/no-hit/failure separation.
- Wire the smallest fixed CD6 Marmic route, run it from an immutable commit, and
  collect structured evidence before broadening coordinate sources or model
  variants.

### Next exact starting point

Read this entry, then inspect the installed Phenix wrapper's model-error
handling. Finish the Python funnel and Phaser adapter before extending the
Nextflow/HPC profile. Use the public 8OOX output only as a parser/positive-control
fixture; do not tune the CD6 scientific conclusion against it.

## 2026-08-11 — First-copy implementation and fixed P2 route

### Discoveries

- Phaser's early “top FTF did not pack” advisory is not final packing evidence;
  the parser must use the final accepted/packed table and preserve the advisory
  as a warning.
- A test profile cannot prove `-resume` behaviour while deleting its work after
  the first run. Test work now survives only within the harness's disposable
  temporary root and is removed when that root closes.
- The qualified P0 allowed root may span a broad shared site tree. Recursively
  searching it for the fixed CD6 MTZ would create avoidable NFS metadata I/O and
  could find stale duplicates. P2 now resolves the MTZ only from the frozen P0
  bundle's deterministic `manifests/` plus `inputs/` layout.
- Unpredictable shared-filesystem startup is not a scientific reason for a
  short Phaser deadline. The adapter has no default timeout; the fixed Marmic
  process and controller use the site's conservative 1,000-hour observation
  margin without implicit cancellation.

### Accomplishments and evidence

- Implemented the exact-predicted-model funnel with exact mapping and checksum
  validation, physical-impossibility exclusion, inspectable features,
  deterministic per-model/global caps, and one immutable record per MR job.
- Implemented the isolated first-copy Phenix adapter and parser. It records the
  resolved command and input digests, separates hit, no-hit, tool, parse,
  infrastructure, and input-contract outcomes, uses final packing evidence, and
  enforces strict `LLG > 100` and `TFZ > 10` inequalities.
- Added the typed `screen_first_copy.nf` route, process modules, frozen stubs,
  publication checks, and a verified fully cached second run.
- Added the checksum-gated fixed P2 controller route. It replays P0/P1, accepts
  no arbitrary path or scientific argument, runs only the bounded CD6
  hypothesis, validates the normalised result, requires a cached resume, and
  collects only approved small artefacts.
- The complete local gate passed: Ruff formatting/lint, strict mypy, 260 unit
  tests, 53 contract tests, 36 integration tests, schema and public-panel
  validation, documentation links, GitHub workflow linting, Nextflow syntax,
  every stub/resume route, and HPC shell syntax.

### Unresolved work

- Review and commit the focused implementation, push the immutable revision,
  and confirm GitHub Actions.
- Build and checksum the local controller, deploy the checksum-verified remote
  tools, then run and collect the first real Marmic P2 result.
- Review that real result before deciding whether the next smallest step is a
  parser/source correction, a broader model/provider funnel, or the remaining
  positive/no-solution and review-package work in the P2 gate.

### Next exact starting point

Read this entry, inspect the complete staged diff for unintended files or
scientific-policy changes, and create the immutable P2 candidate commit only if
the tree remains focused and the full gate still passes. Then use only the
reviewed wrapper for deploy, readiness, stage, submit, wait, logs, and collect;
do not clean remote evidence automatically.
